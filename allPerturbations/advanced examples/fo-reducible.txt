Recall this fact: EVEN is not expressible in FO over a total order.

Theorem. Connectivity is not expressible in FO.

Proof. Suppose \phi is a sentence over the relational vocabulary
consisting of a single binary relation E such that

    (V,E) |= \phi  <==>  (V,E) is connected.

Then we construct a sentence \psi over the vocabulary < such that

    (L_n, <) |= \psi  <==>  n is odd.

Define a formula \gamma(x, y) over the vocabulary < by

    \gamma(x, y) := (y is the successor of the successor of x via <) \vee
                    (x is the maximal element of < and y is the second to minimal element of <) \vee
                    (x is the second to maximal element of < and y is the minimal element of <).

Note that each of these disjuncts can be written in FO over the vocabulary <.

Then let \psi := \phi[\gamma / E]. That is, \psi is a sentence
constructed by substituting \gamma for E everywhere in \phi. Thus, while
\phi was a formula over the vocabulary E, \psi is a formula over the
vocabulary < (because we replaced the only relation symbol, E, with a
formula \gamma over the vocabulary <).

Then notice (by staring at a picture for various small n) that \psi is
true iff n is odd. But this contradicts the fact that evenness (or, by
negation, oddness) is not expressible in FO. We conclude that \phi 
must not exist, so Connectivity is not FO expressible.

------------------------------------------------------------

The "reduction" here is really the formula \gamma, which shows how to
translate a supposed formula for answering connectivity queries into a
formula for answering evenness queries, by substituting \gamma for E
in the supposed connectivity formula.  The reduction is a FO-reduction
because \gamma itself is expressible in FO.
